  <h3> Life </h3>
  <p>Albert Einstein grew up in Munich, where his father founded an electrical engineering company. After studying at
    the ETH university in Zurich, Einstein worked at the patent office in Bern, during which time he produced several
    pioneering works in the field of physics. He was later employed at universities in Bern, Zurich, and Prague, and
    from 1914, in Berlin. After the Nazis seized power in Germany, Einstein immigrated to the US, where he worked at the
    Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Albert Einstein married twice and had three children by his
    first marriage.</p>
  <h3> Work </h3>
  <p>If metal electrodes are exposed to light, electrical sparks between them occur more readily. For this
    "photoelectric effect" to occur, the light waves must be above a certain frequency, however. According to physics
    theory, the light's intensity should be critical. In one of several epoch-making studies beginning in 1905, Albert
    Einstein explained that light consists of quanta - "packets" with fixed energies corresponding to certain
    frequencies. One such light quantum, a photon, must have a certain minimum frequency before it can liberate an
    electron. </p>
